              <p class="lead mt-2 mb-4">
                I am Erdal Ozkaya, a distinguished educator turned software
                developer, whose remarkable career journey has bridged
                continents and spanned across the fields of education and
                technology. Born and raised in Turkey, my academic journey began
                at Middle Technical University (Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi)
                in Ankara, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Physics.
                This early foray into the sciences, combined with my initial
                programming experiences in Fortran, sparked a lifelong passion
                for technology and education.
              </p>

              <p class="lead mt-2 mb-4">
                For over two decades, I dedicated my career to shaping young
                minds as a Physics Teacher. My commitment to education and my
                leadership abilities eventually led me to serve as a High School
                Principal for more than ten years, with my career taking me from
                Uzbekistan to South Africa. In these roles, I not only shared
                knowledge but also played a pivotal role in the administrative
                and developmental aspects of school management, contributing
                significantly to the educational landscape in each country.
              </p>
              <p class="lead mt-2 mb-4">
                In 2019, I embarked on a new chapter in Canada, seeking fresh
                horizons and opportunities. This transition marked a pivotal
                point in my career, as I decided to delve into the world of
                software development—a field that had intrigued me since my
                university days. Recognizing the importance of formal education
                in this new domain, I enrolled in the Computer Programming and
                Analysis Program at George Brown College in 2021. This program,
                with its comprehensive curriculum and focus on practical skills,
                was the perfect match for my ambitions.
              </p>
              <p class="lead mt-2 mb-4">
                Throughout the three years in the program, I diligently honed my
                software development skills, embracing the challenges of coding,
                system analysis, and software engineering. My journey culminated
                in April 2024, when I graduated from the program, poised to
                embark on a new career path in the technology sector.
              </p>
              <p class="lead mt-2 mb-4">
                My story is one of resilience, adaptability, and lifelong
                learning. From the classrooms of Turkey, Uzbekistan, and South
                Africa to the tech hubs of Canada, I have continually evolved,
                driven by a passion for education and technology. As I step into
                the software development industry, I bring with me a wealth of
                experience, a unique perspective, and an unwavering commitment
                to excellence.
